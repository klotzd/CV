# Julia Examples

Learnt a bit of Julia this summer via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming) and [QuantEcon](https://julia.quantecon.org/) and enjoy the language very much. Two small projects from the process:

## Example 1: Modelling the 2014 west african ebola epidemic

## Example 2: The McCall job search model
